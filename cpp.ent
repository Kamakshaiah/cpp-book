stands
for
\emph
{Portable
Operating
System
Interface
(POSIX)}.
There
are
few
ways
to
get
POSIX
based
Linux
run-time
libraries
to
Windows.
Two
of
the
most
famous
ways
is
either
through
MinGW
or
Cygwin.
However,
there
are
umpteen
number
of
portals
or
sites
for
these
libraries.
Two
of
the
most
famous
things
(apart
from
downloading
straight
from
their
respective
portals)
is
either
using
\url
{https://winlibs.com/}
or
\url
{http://win-builds.org/doku.php}.
Winlibs
is
perhaps
most
straight
forward
approach
for
setting
up
POSIX
environments
in
Windows.
